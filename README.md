## Red Zone PoS Frontend

This is the frotend for a  small High School project. I was never finished, and there is no backend.
I might continue working on it if I find some time.

### Disclaimer
This is **probably** my first frontend project, so maybe the structure is a little messy,
but if you have any recomendations they are always welcome. You can email me at
jdominguez@zaroz.es


### Built With
